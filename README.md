# TMDC Experiments Repository
## Spectroscopy, Moiré physics & quantum-light generation in 2D materials

Welcome to the "TMDC experiments" repository of the Quantum Optics in the Solid-State group at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
This repository collects the tools, analysis pipelines, and experiment-control code used in our research on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and Moiré heterostructures.

#### Our focus spans cryogenic photoluminescence, spectroscopy, single-photon emission, and polarization-resolved experiments on 2D materials such as WSe₂, MoSe₂ and their twisted heterobilayers.

## 🎯 Purpose

### This repository serves as a centralized and reproducible archive for:

- Processing and fitting photoluminescence spectra
(Lorentzian / Gaussian fits, multi-peak deconvolution, energy–wavelength conversion, Jacobian correction)

- Automating polarization tomography
(waveplate control, Jones/Stokes reconstruction, Mueller–Jones transformations)

- Performing correlation measurements
g⁽¹⁾(τ) visibility functions
g⁽²⁾(τ) antibunching/bunching fitting
Spatial and polarization correlations of Moiré excitons

- Organizing measurement automation scripts
for cryogenic setups, rotation stages, and spectral scans

- Maintaining calibration utilities
(laser power ↔ sample power, spectrometer wavelength correction, angle–voltage mapping, etc.)

#### Our ultimate goal is to enhance reproducibility, efficiency, and collaborative development in all TMD-related experiments of the QOSS group.

## 🧬 Scientific Scope

### This repository includes tools for experiments on:

🌈 Inter- and intra-layer excitons at cryogenic temperatures

🌀 Moiré heterostructures (e.g., MoSe₂/WSe₂ twisted bilayers)

💡 Single-photon emitters in TMD structures

🔦 Polarization-resolved spectroscopy

📡 Quantum-light correlations (temporal & spatial)
